THE CHALLENGE

In the resources section, you will find some information about performance of different
keywords, adgroups and campaigns that we run in SEM, stored as a csv file. We would like
you to perform a deep dive into this data using the tools of your choice and address each of
the following questions:
	• Give an overview of the dataset and highlight interesting findings in the data
	• Select breakouts (e.g., market_code, device type, theme_name, etc..) and
		metrics (e.g., any of the provided or engineered ones like conversion) you think are relevant
	• What is the best performing Market for company name?
	• Give your definition of performance and explain why we need to look at
		performance using your proposed definition
	• What are the global and market average company name revenue per clickin?
	• What does it measure?
	• Which metric(s) would you consider as other valuable KPI for measuring
		performance? Why?
	• How can we use `user_engagement` to explain `pub_keyword_id` or `theme_name` value?
	• What are the Clickout to Booking ratios by locale and what are possible explanations
		for observed differences? What could the SEM team do, to increase the C2B?
	• What should be the average price to pay for a conversion (defined as clickouts) if we
		wanted a 125% ROAS (clickout_rev/cost)?
	• SEM team has tested a new bidding algorithm only in the Australian market (AU)
		during Oct-Nov.
	• Please summarize the business impact of the test, and explain what you
		would suggest as next steps.
	• Describe how we can ensure that your findings are statistical significant?
